# Explanations
- I changed the players model and added an NPC model (that I chose because it looked funny)
- I used a pickup item animation as my additional choice
- I have 2, twin brother agents that the player can recieve information from
- You can speak to both agents and they tell you different things
- The main challenge is the platforming section connecting the two areas
- Score is increased based on the coins you collect, and is given to the player in the UI and at the end of the game
- The item the player can pick up the legendary shrimp statue that has been present since project 1!
- The game's objective is explained by the NPC's


# Additional Features
- Bubble sounds added to buttons
- Different music tracks added for each menu and main game
- Used PBR Texture on obstacles
- Coins for score
- Lighting inside buildings
- Spotlight over statue

# Philosophy
- With the time contraint following the final project, I wanted to focus on eploring pro-builder and what I can do with it (building small structures and altering shapes) without creating too many things. By creating a short platforming section I was able to accomplish this. 
- This assignment was less about creating the most compelling story (if that wasn't obvious) and more about show casing the skills I've learned fairly quickly

# Final Thoughts
Thank you for a great semester!!! I learned so much is such a short amount of time, it didn't even feel possible going in. I loved the course! Can't wait for next year!
